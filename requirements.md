## Project Owner Requirements
- Project Owner wants us to utilize our gacha system to advertise his favorite songs (vocaloid)
>- Gave example incorporation of ["Lost Time Memory"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9wrDGfYCWA) as a high rarity song
- Wants a consistent thematic, gave us an suggestion of the [Kagerou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagerou_Project) theme, but allowed us to go alternative path
- Wanted us to experiment with a [side bar navbar](https://bootstrapious.com/p/bootstrap-sidebar) rather than the traditional top screen navbar
