### Rarity Establishment
- Each character will have its own rarity, which will be determined by the project owner

- Material theme webpage mockup color scheme [here](https://material-theme.com/), will ikley implement from this source

- Because we store the collected information, we will utiilze users to save their collected items
- Currently discussing with project owner whether or not admin + user relation is needed to update or change the character rarity database
## Sponsor:
- Current sponsor of project is Anthony
- Student connection allows us to maintain close connection, as his availiability is more frequent than teacher or other kind of person
## Hosting Plan
- Chris has isolated computer purposed for deployment
- Because of isolation, his machine will be consistently deployed throughout the year for 24/7 project uptime
## Github License
