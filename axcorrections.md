- **Thought process:** I originally thought that the random number generator was between 0 and 1, and since a is added to a multiple of it, the range would be a to 2a
- **Why I was wrong:** Random returns 0 (inclusive) to 1 (exclusive), which means the range is from a to 2a-1 rather than a to 2a
 
 **Question 19**

 - **Thought process:** I thought the loop would result in the doubling of the row values rather than the column values
 - **Why I was wrong:** I mixed up the J and K, and the column should actually be doubled rather than the row
 
 **Question 21**

- **Thought process:** Was mainly just lost on this question and guessed
- **Why I was wrong:** Method assigns shortest string, which in this case in of, and then assigns arr[3] at the end which would be spring

 **Question 22**
 - Same prompt as before
 - ![Answer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/593331093130838016/968900076011388928/unknown.png)
 - **Thought process:** Assumed that the algorithm iterated through the whole list which is 6 elements
 - **Why I was wrong:** Line 12 executes each time sm is updated, which totals out to 4 times
