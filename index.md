# MusicGacha Project Page

## Project Theme

- MusicGacha: We are creating a game where you are able to open "things" and receive music and famous people around the globe. 

- Background: "Gacha is a genre of Japanese origin and started in the early 2010s. It is the basis for almost all games in Japan and soon became popular in Korea and China. Now it is in demand worldwide with its franchise from big names like Riot, Supercell, and Star Wars. The term Gacha game was coined concerning the Toy Vending machine which is called Gacha in Japanese. Just like we have vending machines for snacks and beverages, Japan has dedicated cute anime toy vending machines."
