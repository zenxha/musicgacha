# PBL Week 1 Reflection

## Faculty Lectures
### Unit 1 Lecture
**Primitive Data Types**
- Declaration tells Java the type of variable you want to make (ex: int num;)
>- Assigning value is next step (num = 3;)
>- 2 steps can be done together (int num = 3;)
- int prepresents integers, double represents decimals, etc
>- Doubles include fractional portions, but integers dont, therefore doubles cannot be stored as integers (can't add integers and doulbes and store as int)
- Multiple numeric primitive data types due to memory

|Integers|Floating Point Numbers|
|---|---|
|byte - 1 byte|float - 4 bytes|
|short - 2 bytes|double - 8 bytes|
|int - 4 bytes||
|long - 8 bytes||

- More bytes represents larger number, but takes more memopry
>- we want to conserve memory used, can help with **optimization**

**Characters and Booleans**
- char is unicode encoding, wich is used for characters (2 bytes)
- boolean is true/false (1 byte)

**Final Thoughts**
- OOP in java doesn't want to limit the data types a user can use
- 8 primitive types, but these let us build off of it to create our own data types
